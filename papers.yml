    The availability of reliable socioeconomic data is critical for the design
    of urban policies and the implementation of location-based services;
    however, often, their temporal and geographical coverage remain scarce. We
    explore the potential for insurance customers data to predict socioeconomic
    indicators of Swiss municipalities. First, we define a features space by
    aggregating at city-level individual customer data along several behavioral
    and user profile dimensions. Second, we collect official statistics shared
    by the Swiss authorities on a wide spectrum of categories: Population,
    Transportation, Work, Space and Territory, Housing, and Economy. Third, we
    adopt two spatial regression models exploring both global and local
    geographical dependencies to investigate their predictability. Results show
    consistently a correlation between insurance customer characteristics and
    official socioeconomic indexes. Performance fluctuates depending on the
    category, with values of R2 > 0.6 for several target variables using a
    5-fold cross validation. As a case study, we focus on predicting the
    percentage of the population using public transportation and we discuss the
    implications on a regional scope. We believe that this methodology can
    support official statistical offices and it could open up new opportunities
    for the characterization of socioeconomic traits at highly-granular spatial
    and temporal scales.

    Urban population grows constantly. By 2050 two thirds of the world
    population will reside in urban areas. This growth is faster and more
    complex than the ability of cities to measure and plan for their
    sustainability. To understand what makes a city inclusive for all, we define
    a methodology to identify and characterize spatial subdivisions: areas with
    over- and under-representation of specific population groups, named hot and
    cold spots respectively. Using aggregated mobile phone data, we apply this
    methodology to the city of Barcelona to assess the mobility of three groups
    of people: women, elders, and tourists. We find that, within the three
    groups, cold spots have a lower diversity of amenities and services than hot
    spots. Also, cold spots of women and tourists tend to have lower population
    income. These insights apply to the floating population of Barcelona, thus
    augmenting the scope of how inclusiveness can be analyzed in the city.

    When the spatial information of each location is given specifically as
    coordinates it is popular to use the geographically weighted regression to
    incorporate the spatial information by assuming that the regression
    parameters vary spatially across locations. In this paper, we relax the
    linearity assumption of geographically weighted regression and propose a
    geographically weighted least squares-support vector machine for estimating
    geographically weighted mean by using the basic concept of kernel machines.
    Generalized cross validation function is induced for the model selection.
    Numerical studies with real datasets have been conducted to compare the
    performance of proposed method with other methods for predicting
    geographically weighted mean.

    MobInsight: Understanding Urban Mobility with Crowd-Powered Neighborhood
    Characterizations
  title-short: MobInsight
  type: paper-conference

  abstract: >-
    Collective urban mobility embodies the residents' local insights on the
    city. Mobility practices of the residents are produced from their spatial
    choices, which involve various considerations such as the atmosphere of
    destinations, distance, past experiences, and preferences. The advances in
    mobile computing and the rise of geo-social platforms have provided the
    means for capturing the mobility practices; however, interpreting the
    residents' insights is challenging due to the scale and complexity of an
    urban environment, and its unique context. In this paper, we present
    MobInsight, a framework for making localized interpretations of urban
    mobility that reflect various aspects of the urbanism. MobInsight extracts a
    rich set of neighborhood features through holistic semantic aggregation, and
    models the mobility between all-pairs of neighborhoods. We evaluate
    MobInsight with the mobility data of Barcelona and demonstrate diverse
    localized and semantically-rich interpretations.

    Objective: This study investigated the relationships between PM2.5 and 5
    criteria air pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM10, CO, and O3) in Heilongjiang, China,
    from 2015 to 2018 using global and geographically and temporally weighted
    regression models. Methods: Ordinary least squares regression (OLS), linear
    mixed models (LMM), geographically weighted regression (GWR), temporally
    weighted regression (TWR), and geographically and temporally weighted
    regression (GTWR) were applied to model the relationships between PM2.5 and
    5 air pollutants. Results: The LMM and all GWR-based models (i.e., GWR, TWR,
    and GTWR) showed great advantages over OLS in terms of higher model R2 and
    more desirable model residuals, especially TWR and GTWR. The GWR, LMM, TWR,
    and GTWR improved the model explanation power by 3%, 5%, 12%, and 12%,
    respectively, from the R2 (0.85) of OLS. TWR yielded slightly better model
    performance than GTWR and reduced the root mean squared errors (RMSE) and
    mean absolute error (MAE) of the model residuals by 67% compared with OLS;
    while GWR only reduced RMSE and MAE by 15% against OLS. LMM performed
    slightly better than GWR by accounting for both temporal autocorrelation
    between observations over time and spatial heterogeneity across the 13
    cities under study, which provided an alternative for modeling PM2.5.
    Conclusions: The traditional OLS and GWR are inadequate for describing the
    non-stationarity of PM2.5. The temporal dependence was more important and
    significant than spatial heterogeneity in our data. Our study provided
    evidence of spatialâ€“temporal heterogeneity and possible solutions for
    modeling the relationships between PM2.5 and 5 criteria air pollutants for
    Heilongjiang province, China.
